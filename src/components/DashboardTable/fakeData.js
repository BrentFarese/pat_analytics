This is a first action on the merits of application 15/064,521.\n\n2. Claims 1-12 are pending.\n\n3. Applicant did not provide an Information Disclosure Statement.\nDouble Patenting\n4. The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created\n\ndoctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the\nunjustified or improper timewise extension of the fright to exclude\" granted by a patent\nand to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double\npatenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at issue are not identical, but at least\none examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s)\nbecause the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been\nobvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d\n1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir.\n1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum,\n686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619\n(CCPA 1970); and In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\n\nA timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321 (c) or 1.321(d)\nmay be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory\ndouble patenting ground provided the reference application or patent either is shown to\n\nbe commonly owned with this application, or claims an invention made as a result of\n\n\n\nApplication/Control Number: 15/064,521 Page 3\nArt Unit: 3617\n\nactivities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. A terminal\ndisclaimer must be signed in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321 (b).\n\nThe USPTO internet Web site contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be\nused. Please visit http://www.uspto.gov/forms/. The filing date of the application will\ndetermine what form should be used. A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled\nout completely online using web-screens. An eTerminal Disclaimer that meets all\nrequirements is auto-processed and approved immediately upon submission. For more\ninformation about eTerminal Disclaimers, refer to\nhttp://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/efs/guidance/eTD-info-l.jsp.\n\n5. Claims 1-12 are provisionally rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double\npatenting as being unpatentable over claims 1-4 and 13-30 of copending Application\nNo. 14/509,289. Although the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably\ndistinct from each other because they are fully encompassed in scope by the above\nclaims.\n\nThis is a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection because the\n\npatentably indistinct claims have not in fact been patented.\n\nConclusion\n6. Any inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the\nexaminer should be directed to JOVON HAYES whose telephone number is (571 )272-\n\n3115. The examiner can normally be reached on Monday - Friday.\n\n\n\nApplication/Control Number: 15/064,521 Page 4\nArt Unit: 3617\n\nIf attempts to reach the examiner by telephone are unsuccessful, the examineris\nsupervisor, Samuel (Joe) Morano can be reached on 5712726684. The fax phone\nnumber for the organization where this application or proceeding is assigned is 571 -\n273-8300.\n\nInformation regarding the status of an application may be obtained from the\nPatent Application Information Retrieval (PAIR) system. Status information for\npublished applications may be obtained from either Private PAIR or Public PAIR.\nStatus information for unpublished applications is available through Private PAIR only.\nFor more information about the PAIR system, see http://pair-direct.uspto.gov.

The present application is being examined under the pre-AIA first to invent\nprovisions.\nDETAILED ACTION\nSpecification\n2. The title of the invention is not descriptive. A new title is required that is clearly\n\nindicative of the invention to which the claims are directed.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC ยง 102\n3. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.\n\n102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:\n\nA person shall be entitled to a patent unless -\n\n(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country\nor in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application\nfor patent in the United States.\n\n4. Claims 1 and 2 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated\nby US 2012/0033149 A1 (SONG et al).\nRegarding claim 1, SONG teaches (paragraphs 0033-0036; Figs.6A, GB) that an\narray substrate (first substrate 1) comprising a base substrate (conventionally having a\nglass substrate), a plurality of gate lines (2) and a plurality of data lines (3) formed on\nthe base substrate, and a plurality of pixel units defined by the plurality of gate lines (2)\nand the plurality of data lines (3) intersecting with each other, wherein:\n- each pixel unit (the first electrode 4 functions as pixel electrode having first\nregion 41 and second region 42 functions as a first pixel unit and a second pixel unit) is\n\ndriven by a same gate line (2) and a same data line (3);\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 3\nArt Unit: 2871\n\n- each pixel unit includes a thin film transistor structure and at least two display\nregions (41, 42), each display region includes a pixel electrode (such as shown in\nFig.68 having pixel electrode 4), the thin film transistor structure drives the pixel\nelectrodes (4) in the at least two display regions (41,42) simultaneously and causes\nvoltages applied on the pixel electrodes (4) in the at least two display regions (41,42)\ndifferent from each other such as shown in the Fig.6A.\n\nRegarding claim 2, SONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the pixel unit includes two\ndisplay regions (41, 42) disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line (2) for\n\ndiving the pixel unit.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC ยง 103\n5. The text of those sections of Title 35, U.S. Code not included in this action can\nbe found in a prior Office action.\n6. The following is a quotation of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis\n\nfor all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described\nas set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to\nbe patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been\nobvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\n\n7. Claims 3-19 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable\nover US 2012/0033149 A1 (SONG et al) and in view of US 2008/0018573 A1 (Hsieh et\n\nal) .\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 4\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nRegarding claims 3-8 and 12-15, SONG teaches the invention set forth above\nand applied to the claims 1 and 2.\n\nConcerning the thin film transistor structure is a composite thin film transistor,\nHsieh teaches (Fig.4A and paragraphs 0025-0029) that the active devices (413a, 413b)\nfunctions as a switching elements of thin film transistors so that such composite thin film\ntransistor (413) includes a gate electrode, a common source electrode, two drain\nelectrodes and conventionally two channels formed respectively between the common\nsource electrode and the two drain electrodes, and that is common and known in the\nart.\n\nSONG further teaches (Figs 6A, GB) such gate electrode is connected to the gate\nline (2) for driving the pixel unit; the common source electrode (8) is connected to the\ndata line (3) for driving the pixel unit; and the drain electrode (9) can be upper portion\nand lower portion as the two drain electrodes are connected respectively to the pixel\nelectrodes (4) in the two display region (41, 42);\n\nSuch composite thin film transistor as shown in Hsieh (Fig.4A) or the thin film\ntransistor as shown in SONG (Fig.6A) must have two channels formed respectively\nbetween the common source electrode and the two drain electrode, and such two\nchannels being different from each other in channel length and the two channel width of\n20-30um that would be obvious to those killed in the art according the forming process\napplied.\n\nSONG further teaches that the gate electrode is a single common gate electrode,\n\nand conventionally, the gate electrode having two separate gate electrodes that would\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 5\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nbe easier to drive the pixel unit, and that would have been at least obvious to those\nskilled in the art.\n\nSONG further teaches that an area ratio of the two display region is 1 :1 -1 :9 or\nthat is 1 :1 as shown in Fig.6A\n\nSONG further teaches that the thin film transistor structure is provided on the left\nside of the pixel unit such as shown in Fig.6A or the thin film transistor structure is\nprovided on the right side of the pixel unit such as shown in Fig.4A.\n\nRegarding claims 9-11, SONG teaches the invention set forth above. lnherently, each display\nregion includes a common electrode and a pixel electrode for generate an electrical field. Further, the\npixel electrode and the common electrode must be separated each other by an insulating layer.\nSONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the pixel electrode (4) includes strip electrodes as shown in\nFig.6A. So that, conventionally, the pixel electrode is disposed above the common electrode and the\npixel electrode includes strip electrodes, or the common electrode is disposed above the pixel\nelectrode and the common electrode includes strip electrodes for generating an electric field and that\nis conventional and that would have been at least obvious. SONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the\nstrip electrodes of each display region (41, 42) include a first group of strip electrodes and a second\ngroup of strip electrodes; and the strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes are parallel to\none another, and the strip electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes are parallel to one\nanother; and an inclination direction of the strip electrodes in the two groups of the strip electrodes is\ndifferent and symmetrically in each display region (41,42) as shown in Fig.6A. Concerning the liquid\ncrystal using positive liquid crystal or negative liquid crystal, according to the property of the liquid\n\ncrystal molecules that the angle between an inclination direction of the strip electrode and an initial\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 6\nArt Unit: 2871\n\norientation direction of the liquid crystal would be set a certain range such as 5-20(positive liquid\ncrystal) or 70-85(negative) that would be according to the property of the liquid crystal, and that\nwould have been at least obvious.\n\nRegarding claims 16-18, SONG teaches the invention set forth above. SONG further teaches\n(Fig.6A) that the pixel unit includes the two display regions (41, 42) disposed respectively on two\nsides of the data line (3) for driving the pixel unit. SONG further teaches (Fig.5) that the pixel unit\nincludes four display regions (41, 42, 43, 44) disposed respectively in four regions by the data line (3)\nfor driving the pixel unit and the gate line (2) for driving the pixel unit intersecting with each other.\nConcerning the pixel unit includes three display regions disposed on a same date line for driving the\npixel unit and on a same side of the gate line for driving the pixel unit that would be an obvious\nvariation and that would be obvious to those skilled in the art according to the forming process being\napplied.\n\nRegarding claim 19, any display devices can use such array substrate that are only given\n\nweight as intended use, and that would have been at least obvious.\n\nConclusion\n8. The prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to\napplicant's disclosure.\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the\nexaminer should be directed to MIKE OI whose telephone number is (571)272-2299.\n\nThe examiner can normally be reached on M-T 7:30 am-6:00 pm.\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 7\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nIf attempts to reach the examiner by telephone are unsuccessful, the examinerls\nsupervisor, Bumsuk Won can be reached on (571) 272-2713.

			"In recent years, liquid crystal display of advanced super dimensional switching (AD-SDS, ADS for short) mode has been widely applied. In the ADS mode, a multi-dimensional electric field is formed with both an electric field generated at edges of slit electrodes in a same plane and an electric field generated between a slit electrode layer and a plate-like electrode layer, so that liquid crystal molecules at all orientations, which are located directly above the electrodes or between the slit electrodes in a liquid crystal cell, can be rotated, In this way, the work efficiency of liquid crystal can be enhanced and the light transmittance can be increased. The ADS mode can improve the image quality of the thin film transistor liquid crystal display and has advantages of high resolution, high transmittance, low power consumption, wide viewing angle, high aperture ratio, low chromatic aberration, high response speed, free of push Mura, etc.",
			"An array substrate of the ADS mode liquid crystal display comprises two layers of transparent electrodes, i.e. a first transparent electrode and a second transparent electrode disposed above the first transparent electrode. One of the first transparent electrode and the second transparent electrode is used as a pixel electrode and connected to a drain electrode of a thin film transistor, and the other is used as a common electrode and connected to a common electrode line. The second transparent electrode includes stripe electrodes having a certain width and separated from each other at a certain interval, so the second transparent electrode is also called a slit electrode. The second transparent electrode and the first transparent electrode are arranged with one overlapping the other, and the first transparent electrode and the second transparent electrode are separated from each other with an insulating layer.",

The thin film transistor includes a gate electrode (not shown), a source electrode  and drain electrodes . Referring to , the strip electrodes  of the pixel electrode all incline in one direction. When the conventional liquid crystal display operates, liquid crystal deflects as driven by the electric field, and the liquid crystal  in each pixel unit only has one deflection angle, as shown in . Due to anisotropy of the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal display has differences in brightness when it is viewed from different viewing angles, and has certain chromatic aberration.",
			" is an array substrate of another conventional ADS mode liquid crystal display. As shown in , the pixel unit has a two-domain display region (the display region of the pixel unit is a region covered by the pixel electrode except for the thin film transistor), that is, the stripe electrodes  in each pixel unit have two inclination angles. When the liquid crystal display operates, the liquid crystal deflects as driven by the electric field, and the liquid crystal  in each pixel unit has two deflection angles, as shown in . Due to the averaging effect of deflection of the liquid crystal , differences in brightness of the liquid crystal display when the liquid crystal display is viewed from different viewing angles decrease, and chromatic aberration is improved in some degree.",

			"In order to make the object, technical solution and advantages of the embodiments of the invention clearer, the technical solution in the embodiments of the invention shall be clearly and completely described hereinafter in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Obviously, the described embodiments are part of rather than all of the embodiments of the invention. Based on the embodiments of the invention, all the other embodiments that a person ordinarily skilled in the art obtains without inventive effort are within the scope of the invention.",
			"Embodiment 1",
			"As shown in , an array substrate according to the present embodiment comprises: a base substrate, a plurality of gate lines  and a plurality of data lines  formed on the base substrate, and a plurality of pixel units defined by the plurality of gate lines  and the plurality of data lines  intersecting with each other. As an example,  merely shows one pixel unit. Each pixel unit is driven by a same gate line  and a same data line , and each pixel unit includes a thin film transistor structure and two display regions. Each display region includes a pixel electrode. The thin film transistor structure drives the pixel electrodes in the two display regions simultaneously, and causes voltages applied on the pixel electrodes in the two display regions different from each other.",
			"For example, as shown in . the two display regions are disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line  for driving the pixel unit.",
			"In this embodiment, the thin film transistor structure is a composite thin film transistor and comprises: a gate electrode (not shown in the drawings), a common source electrode , two drain electrodes , and two channels formed respectively between the common source electrode  and the two drain electrodes . The gate electrode is connected to the gate line , the common source electrode  is connected to the data line , the two drain electrodes  are connected respectively to the pixel electrodes in the two display regions, and the two channels formed respectively between the common source electrode  and the two drain electrodes  are different from each other in channel width.",
			"For example, each of the two channels has the channel width of 20ห30 ฮผm.",
			"It should be noted that the gate electrode of the composite thin film transistor may be a single common gate electrode, or may be two separate gate electrodes, only if the gate electrode is connected to the gate line .",
			"As described above, each display region includes the pixel electrode. In addition, each display region further includes a common electrode. The pixel electrode and the common electrode are separated from each other by an insulating layer. The pixel electrode may be disposed above the common electrode or below the common electrode. The upper one among the pixel electrode and the common electrode includes stripe electrodes, and the lower one among the pixel electrode and the common electrode may include strip electrodes or may be a plate electrode. For example, in this embodiment, the pixel electrode is disposed above the common electrode and includes strip electrodes , and an opening  is provided between adjacent strip electrodes .",
			"In the present embodiment, each display region is a two-domain display region. In other words, in each display region, the strip electrodes  of the pixel electrode include a first group of strip electrodes and a second group of strip electrodes. The strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes are parallel to one another, and the strip electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes are parallel to one another. An inclination direction of the strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes is different from an inclination direction of the stripe electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes, and the first group of strip electrodes and the second group of strip electrodes are arranged symmetrically in each display region.",
			"Since each display region is designed into the two-domain display region, the liquid crystal in each display region has two deflection directions as driven by voltage. In addition, since two channels of the composite thin film transistor are different in channel width, voltages applied on the pixel electrodes in the two display regions connected to the same data line  are different, and the deflection angles of the liquid crystal in the two display regions are different as well. In this way, the liquid crystal  in one pixel unit has four deflection angles, as shown in . Therefore, in different viewing angles, the anisotropy of the liquid crystal can be better averaged, and the chromatic aberration is further reduced.",
			"For example, when the liquid crystal in the display region is a positive liquid crystal, an included angle between the inclination direction of the strip electrodes of the pixel electrode and an initial orientation direction of the positive liquid crystal is 5ยฐห20ยฐ; when the liquid crystal in the display region is a negative liquid crystal, the included angle between the inclination direction of the strip electrodes of the pixel electrode and the initial orientation direction of the negative liquid crystal is 70ยฐห85ยฐ.",
			"For example, an area ratio of the two display regions is 1:1ห1:9. In order to better reduce the chromatic aberration and obtain a better display effect, the area ratio of the two display regions is preferably 1:1.",
			"Embodiment 2",
			"The array substrate according to this embodiment is shown in , and the structure thereof is substantially same as that of the array substrate in Embodiment 1. The array substrate according to this embodiment is different from the array substrate in Embodiment 1 in that this embodiment adopts two separate thin film transistors (each thin film transistor includes a gate electrode, a source electrode, and a drain electrode) to replace the composite thin film transistor in Embodiment 1. The gate electrodes of the two thin film transistors are both connected to the same gate line , the source electrodes  of the two thin film transistors are both connected to the same data line , and the drain electrodes  of the two thin film transistors are connected respectively to the pixel electrodes  in the two display regions. A channel between the source electrode  and the drain electrode  of one of the two thin film transistors is different from a channel between the source electrode  and the drain electrode  of the other of the two thin film transistors in channel width.",
			"For example, each of the channels of the two thin film transistors has the channel width of 20ห30 ฮผm.",
			"The remaining part of the array substrate in this embodiment is the same as that in Embodiment 1, and this embodiment can achieve the same improvement of chromatic aberration as Embodiment 1.",
			"Modified Embodiments",
			"The structure of the array substrate is not limited to the above two embodiments, and any variations of the above two embodiments are also within the protection scope of the invention.",
			"For example, the position of the composite thin film transistor may be different from the position of the composite thin film transistor in Embodiment 1. In Embodiment 1 shown in , the composite thin film transistor is disposed at the left data line for defining the pixel unit. However, the composite thin film transistor may be disposed at the right data line for defining the pixel unit, as shown in . In addition, in , the strip electrodes  are arranged in the same way as in Embodiment 1.",
			"For example, the arrangement manner of the strip electrodes  in each display region may be changed. In Embodiment 1 shown in , the strip electrodes  in the display region above the gate line  are arranged in the same way as the strip electrodes  in the display region below the gate line . However, in , the strip electrodes  in the two display regions are arranged in different ways. As shown in , the stripe electrodes  of the upper group of strip electrodes in the display region above the gate line  have the inclination direction same as the strip electrodes  of the lower group of strip electrodes in the display region below the gate line ; the stripe electrodes  of the lower group of strip electrodes in the display region above the gate line  have the inclination direction same as the strip electrodes  of the upper group of strip electrodes in the display region below the gate line .",
			"It should be noted that the array substrates in  can obtain the same advantageous effects as the array substrates in Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2.",
			"In Embodiment 1, Embodiment 2 and Modified embodiments shown in , the two display regions are disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line  for driving the pixel unit. However, the two display regions may be disposed respectively on two sides of the data line  for driving the pixel unit.",
			"In the above embodiments, each pixel unit includes two display regions, and the liquid crystal in each pixel unit has four deflection angles. In order to make the liquid crystal have more deflection angles and further reduce the chromatic aberration, the number of the display regions of each pixel unit may be larger than two, for example, the number of the display regions of each pixel unit may be three, four or more. In this case, multiple separate thin film transistors which are different in channel width may be adopted to drive the display regions respectively. The pixel unit including three display regions and the pixel unit including four display regions are shown in  and  respectively.",
			"For example, the pixel unit includes three display regions disposed on a same side of the data line for driving the pixel unit and on a same side of the gate line for driving the pixel unit, as shown in .",
			"For example, the pixel unit includes four display regions disposed respectively in four regions defined by the data line for driving the pixel unit and the gate line for driving the pixel unit intersecting with each other, as shown in .",
			"In the case that the pixel unit includes three display regions, it is preferably that the array substrate having such pixel unit is applied to a widescreen display device. In the case that the pixel unit includes four display regions, the thin film transistor structure may adopt the composite thin film transistor with different channel widths, or may adopt a plurality of separate thin film transistors with different channel widths.",
			"If the pixel unit has much more display regions, the liquid crystal in the pixel unit has nร2 deflection angles (n is the number of the display regions in the pixel unit), so that the anisotropy of the liquid crystal can be better averaged and the chromatic aberration can be further reduced.",
			"The more the display regions are, the more complex the fabrication process is, so the preferred number of the display regions is 2, 3 or 4.",
			"Embodiment 3",
			"This embodiment provides a display device, comprising an array substrate in any one of the above embodiments. The display device may be LCD panel, LCD TV, LCD monitor, digital photo frame, mobile phone, pad, or any other product or component having a display function.",
			"The foregoing embodiments merely are exemplary embodiments of the invention, and not intended to define the scope of the invention, and the scope of the invention is determined by the appended claims."

			"In recent years, liquid crystal display of advanced super dimensional switching (AD-SDS, ADS for short) mode has been widely applied. In the ADS mode, a multi-dimensional electric field is formed with both an electric field generated at edges of slit electrodes in a same plane and an electric field generated between a slit electrode layer and a plate-like electrode layer, so that liquid crystal molecules at all orientations, which are located directly above the electrodes or between the slit electrodes in a liquid crystal cell, can be rotated, In this way, the work efficiency of liquid crystal can be enhanced and the light transmittance can be increased. The ADS mode can improve the image quality of the thin film transistor liquid crystal display and has advantages of high resolution, high transmittance, low power consumption, wide viewing angle, high aperture ratio, low chromatic aberration, high response speed, free of push Mura, etc.",
			"An array substrate of the ADS mode liquid crystal display comprises two layers of transparent electrodes, i.e. a first transparent electrode and a second transparent electrode disposed above the first transparent electrode. One of the first transparent electrode and the second transparent electrode is used as a pixel electrode and connected to a drain electrode of a thin film transistor, and the other is used as a common electrode and connected to a common electrode line. The second transparent electrode includes stripe electrodes having a certain width and separated from each other at a certain interval, so the second transparent electrode is also called a slit electrode. The second transparent electrode and the first transparent electrode are arranged with one overlapping the other, and the first transparent electrode and the second transparent electrode are separated from each other with an insulating layer.",
			" is an array substrate of a conventional ADS mode liquid crystal display. The array substrate comprises gate lines , data lines , and pixel units defined by the gate lines  and data lines  intersecting with each other. As shown in , the pixel unit includes a pixel electrode and a thin film transistor. The pixel electrode includes strip electrodes , and an opening  is provided between adjacent strip electrodes. The thin film transistor includes a gate electrode (not shown), a source electrode  and drain electrodes . Referring to , the strip electrodes  of the pixel electrode all incline in one direction. When the conventional liquid crystal display operates, liquid crystal deflects as driven by the electric field, and the liquid crystal  in each pixel unit only has one deflection angle, as shown in . Due to anisotropy of the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal display has differences in brightness when it is viewed from different viewing angles, and has certain chromatic aberration.",
			" is an array substrate of another conventional ADS mode liquid crystal display. As shown in , the pixel unit has a two-domain display region (the display region of the pixel unit is a region covered by the pixel electrode except for the thin film transistor), that is, the stripe electrodes  in each pixel unit have two inclination angles. When the liquid crystal display operates, the liquid crystal deflects as driven by the electric field, and the liquid crystal  in each pixel unit has two deflection angles, as shown in . Due to the averaging effect of deflection of the liquid crystal , differences in brightness of the liquid crystal display when the liquid crystal display is viewed from different viewing angles decrease, and chromatic aberration is improved in some degree.",
			"However, it is necessary to further reduce the differences in brightness of the liquid crystal display so as to reduce chromatic aberration."

			"In order to make the object, technical solution and advantages of the embodiments of the invention clearer, the technical solution in the embodiments of the invention shall be clearly and completely described hereinafter in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Obviously, the described embodiments are part of rather than all of the embodiments of the invention. Based on the embodiments of the invention, all the other embodiments that a person ordinarily skilled in the art obtains without inventive effort are within the scope of the invention.",
			"Embodiment 1",
			"As shown in , an array substrate according to the present embodiment comprises: a base substrate, a plurality of gate lines  and a plurality of data lines  formed on the base substrate, and a plurality of pixel units defined by the plurality of gate lines  and the plurality of data lines  intersecting with each other. As an example,  merely shows one pixel unit. Each pixel unit is driven by a same gate line  and a same data line , and each pixel unit includes a thin film transistor structure and two display regions. Each display region includes a pixel electrode. The thin film transistor structure drives the pixel electrodes in the two display regions simultaneously, and causes voltages applied on the pixel electrodes in the two display regions different from each other.",
			"For example, as shown in , the two display regions are disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line  for driving the pixel unit.",
			"In this embodiment, the thin film transistor structure is a composite thin film transistor and comprises: a gate electrode (not shown in the drawings), a common source electrode , two drain electrodes , and two channels formed respectively between the common source electrode  and the two drain electrodes . The gate electrode is connected to the gate line , the common source electrode  is connected to the data line , the two drain electrodes  are connected respectively to the pixel electrodes in the two display regions, and the two channels formed respectively between the common source electrode  and the two drain electrodes  are different from each other in channel width.",
			"For example, each of the two channels has the channel width of 20ห30 ฮผm.",
			"It should be noted that the gate electrode of the composite thin film transistor may be a single common gate electrode, or may be two separate gate electrodes, only if the gate electrode is connected to the gate line .",
			"As described above, each display region includes the pixel electrode. In addition, each display region further includes a common electrode. The pixel electrode and the common electrode are separated from each other by an insulating layer. The pixel electrode may be disposed above the common electrode or below the common electrode. The upper one among the pixel electrode and the common electrode includes stripe electrodes, and the lower one among the pixel electrode and the common electrode may include strip electrodes or may be a plate electrode. For example, in this embodiment, the pixel electrode is disposed above the common electrode and includes strip electrodes , and an opening  is provided between adjacent strip electrodes .",
			"In the present embodiment, each display region is a two-domain display region. In other words, in each display region, the strip electrodes  of the pixel electrode include a first group of strip electrodes and a second group of strip electrodes. The strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes are parallel to one another, and the strip electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes are parallel to one another. An inclination direction of the strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes is different from an inclination direction of the stripe electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes, and the first group of strip electrodes and the second group of strip electrodes are arranged symmetrically in each display region.",
			"Since each display region is designed into the two-domain display region, the liquid crystal in each display region has two deflection directions as driven by voltage. In addition, since two channels of the composite thin film transistor are different in channel width, voltages applied on the pixel electrodes in the two display regions connected to the same data line  are different, and the deflection angles of the liquid crystal in the two display regions are different as well. In this way, the liquid crystal  in one pixel unit has four deflection angles, as shown in . Therefore, in different viewing angles, the anisotropy of the liquid crystal can be better averaged, and the chromatic aberration is further reduced.",
			"For example, when the liquid crystal in the display region is a positive liquid crystal, an included angle between the inclination direction of the strip electrodes of the pixel electrode and an initial orientation direction of the positive liquid crystal is 5ยฐห20ยฐ; when the liquid crystal in the display region is a negative liquid crystal, the included angle between the inclination direction of the strip electrodes of the pixel electrode and the initial orientation direction of the negative liquid crystal is 70ยฐห85ยฐ.",
			"For example, an area ratio of the two display regions is 1:1ห1:9. In order to better reduce the chromatic aberration and obtain a better display effect, the area ratio of the two display regions is preferably 1:1.",
			"Embodiment 2",
			"The array substrate according to this embodiment is shown in , and the structure thereof is substantially same as that of the array substrate in Embodiment 1. The array substrate according to this embodiment is different from the array substrate in Embodiment 1 in that this embodiment adopts two separate thin film transistors (each thin film transistor includes a gate electrode, a source electrode, and a drain electrode) to replace the composite thin film transistor in Embodiment 1. The gate electrodes of the two thin film transistors are both connected to the same gate line , the source electrodes  of the two thin film transistors are both connected to the same data line , and the drain electrodes  of the two thin film transistors are connected respectively to the pixel electrodes  in the two display regions. A channel between the source electrode  and the drain electrode  of one of the two thin film transistors is different from a channel between the source electrode  and the drain electrode  of the other of the two thin film transistors in channel width.",
			"For example, each of the channels of the two thin film transistors has the channel width of 20ห30 ฮผm.",
			"The remaining part of the array substrate in this embodiment is the same as that in Embodiment 1, and this embodiment can achieve the same improvement of chromatic aberration as Embodiment 1.",
			"Modified Embodiments",
			"The structure of the array substrate is not limited to the above two embodiments, and any variations of the above two embodiments are also within the protection scope of the invention.",
			"For example, the position of the composite thin film transistor may be different from the position of the composite thin film transistor in Embodiment 1. In Embodiment 1 shown in , the composite thin film transistor is disposed at the left data line for defining the pixel unit. However, the composite thin film transistor may be disposed at the right data line for defining the pixel unit, as shown in . In addition, in , the strip electrodes  are arranged in the same way as in Embodiment 1.",
			"For example, the arrangement manner of the strip electrodes  in each display region may be changed. In Embodiment 1 shown in , the strip electrodes  in the display region above the gate line  are arranged in the same way as the strip electrodes  in the display region below the gate line . However, in , the strip electrodes  in the two display regions are arranged in different ways. As shown in , the stripe electrodes  of the upper group of strip electrodes in the display region above the gate line  have the inclination direction same as the strip electrodes  of the lower group of strip electrodes in the display region below the gate line ; the stripe electrodes  of the lower group of strip electrodes in the display region above the gate line  have the inclination direction same as the strip electrodes  of the upper group of strip electrodes in the display region below the gate line .",
			"It should be noted that the array substrates in  can obtain the same advantageous effects as the array substrates in Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2.",
			"In Embodiment 1, Embodiment 2 and Modified embodiments shown in , the two display regions are disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line  for driving the pixel unit. However, the two display regions may be disposed respectively on two sides of the data line  for driving the pixel unit.",
			"In the above embodiments, each pixel unit includes two display regions, and the liquid crystal in each pixel unit has four deflection angles. In order to make the liquid crystal have more deflection angles and further reduce the chromatic aberration, the number of the display regions of each pixel unit may be larger than two, for example, the number of the display regions of each pixel unit may be three, four or more. In this case, multiple separate thin film transistors which are different in channel width may be adopted to drive the display regions respectively. The pixel unit including three display regions and the pixel unit including four display regions are shown in  and  respectively.",
			"For example, the pixel unit includes three display regions disposed on a same side of the data line for driving the pixel unit and on a same side of the gate line for driving the pixel unit, as shown in .",
			"For example, the pixel unit includes four display regions disposed respectively in four regions defined by the data line for driving the pixel unit and the gate line for driving the pixel unit intersecting with each other, as shown in .",
			"In the case that the pixel unit includes three display regions, it is preferably that the array substrate having such pixel unit is applied to a widescreen display device. In the case that the pixel unit includes four display regions, the thin film transistor structure may adopt the composite thin film transistor with different channel widths, or may adopt a plurality of separate thin film transistors with different channel widths.",
			"If the pixel unit has much more display regions, the liquid crystal in the pixel unit has nร2 deflection angles (n is the number of the display regions in the pixel unit), so that the anisotropy of the liquid crystal can be better averaged and the chromatic aberration can be further reduced.",
			"The more the display regions are, the more complex the fabrication process is, so the preferred number of the display regions is 2, 3 or 4.",
			"Embodiment 3",
			"This embodiment provides a display device, comprising an array substrate in any one of the above embodiments. The display device may be LCD panel, LCD TV, LCD monitor, digital photo frame, mobile phone, pad, or any other product or component having a display function.",
			"The foregoing embodiments merely are exemplary embodiments of the invention, and not intended to define the scope of the invention, and the scope of the invention is determined by the appended claims."

The present application is being examined under the pre-AIA first to invent\nprovisions.\nDETAILED ACTION\nSpecification\n2. The title of the invention is not descriptive. A new title is required that is clearly\n\nindicative of the invention to which the claims are directed.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC ยง 102\n3. The following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.\n\n102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:\n\nA person shall be entitled to a patent unless -\n\n(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country\nor in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application\nfor patent in the United States.\n\n4. Claims 1 and 2 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated\nby US 2012/0033149 A1 (SONG et al).\nRegarding claim 1, SONG teaches (paragraphs 0033-0036; Figs.6A, GB) that an\narray substrate (first substrate 1) comprising a base substrate (conventionally having a\nglass substrate), a plurality of gate lines (2) and a plurality of data lines (3) formed on\nthe base substrate, and a plurality of pixel units defined by the plurality of gate lines (2)\nand the plurality of data lines (3) intersecting with each other, wherein:\n- each pixel unit (the first electrode 4 functions as pixel electrode having first\nregion 41 and second region 42 functions as a first pixel unit and a second pixel unit) is\n\ndriven by a same gate line (2) and a same data line (3);\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 3\nArt Unit: 2871\n\n- each pixel unit includes a thin film transistor structure and at least two display\nregions (41, 42), each display region includes a pixel electrode (such as shown in\nFig.68 having pixel electrode 4), the thin film transistor structure drives the pixel\nelectrodes (4) in the at least two display regions (41,42) simultaneously and causes\nvoltages applied on the pixel electrodes (4) in the at least two display regions (41,42)\ndifferent from each other such as shown in the Fig.6A.\n\nRegarding claim 2, SONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the pixel unit includes two\ndisplay regions (41, 42) disposed respectively on two sides of the gate line (2) for\n\ndiving the pixel unit.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC ยง 103\n5. The text of those sections of Title 35, U.S. Code not included in this action can\nbe found in a prior Office action.\n6. The following is a quotation of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis\n\nfor all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described\nas set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to\nbe patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been\nobvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which\nsaid subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the\ninvention was made.\n\n7. Claims 3-19 are rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable\nover US 2012/0033149 A1 (SONG et al) and in view of US 2008/0018573 A1 (Hsieh et\n\nal) .\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 4\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nRegarding claims 3-8 and 12-15, SONG teaches the invention set forth above\nand applied to the claims 1 and 2.\n\nConcerning the thin film transistor structure is a composite thin film transistor,\nHsieh teaches (Fig.4A and paragraphs 0025-0029) that the active devices (413a, 413b)\nfunctions as a switching elements of thin film transistors so that such composite thin film\ntransistor (413) includes a gate electrode, a common source electrode, two drain\nelectrodes and conventionally two channels formed respectively between the common\nsource electrode and the two drain electrodes, and that is common and known in the\nart.\n\nSONG further teaches (Figs 6A, GB) such gate electrode is connected to the gate\nline (2) for driving the pixel unit; the common source electrode (8) is connected to the\ndata line (3) for driving the pixel unit; and the drain electrode (9) can be upper portion\nand lower portion as the two drain electrodes are connected respectively to the pixel\nelectrodes (4) in the two display region (41, 42);\n\nSuch composite thin film transistor as shown in Hsieh (Fig.4A) or the thin film\ntransistor as shown in SONG (Fig.6A) must have two channels formed respectively\nbetween the common source electrode and the two drain electrode, and such two\nchannels being different from each other in channel length and the two channel width of\n20-30um that would be obvious to those killed in the art according the forming process\napplied.\n\nSONG further teaches that the gate electrode is a single common gate electrode,\n\nand conventionally, the gate electrode having two separate gate electrodes that would\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 5\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nbe easier to drive the pixel unit, and that would have been at least obvious to those\nskilled in the art.\n\nSONG further teaches that an area ratio of the two display region is 1 :1 -1 :9 or\nthat is 1 :1 as shown in Fig.6A\n\nSONG further teaches that the thin film transistor structure is provided on the left\nside of the pixel unit such as shown in Fig.6A or the thin film transistor structure is\nprovided on the right side of the pixel unit such as shown in Fig.4A.\n\nRegarding claims 9-11, SONG teaches the invention set forth above. lnherently, each display\nregion includes a common electrode and a pixel electrode for generate an electrical field. Further, the\npixel electrode and the common electrode must be separated each other by an insulating layer.\nSONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the pixel electrode (4) includes strip electrodes as shown in\nFig.6A. So that, conventionally, the pixel electrode is disposed above the common electrode and the\npixel electrode includes strip electrodes, or the common electrode is disposed above the pixel\nelectrode and the common electrode includes strip electrodes for generating an electric field and that\nis conventional and that would have been at least obvious. SONG further teaches (Fig.6A) that the\nstrip electrodes of each display region (41, 42) include a first group of strip electrodes and a second\ngroup of strip electrodes; and the strip electrodes in the first group of strip electrodes are parallel to\none another, and the strip electrodes in the second group of strip electrodes are parallel to one\nanother; and an inclination direction of the strip electrodes in the two groups of the strip electrodes is\ndifferent and symmetrically in each display region (41,42) as shown in Fig.6A. Concerning the liquid\ncrystal using positive liquid crystal or negative liquid crystal, according to the property of the liquid\n\ncrystal molecules that the angle between an inclination direction of the strip electrode and an initial\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 6\nArt Unit: 2871\n\norientation direction of the liquid crystal would be set a certain range such as 5-20(positive liquid\ncrystal) or 70-85(negative) that would be according to the property of the liquid crystal, and that\nwould have been at least obvious.\n\nRegarding claims 16-18, SONG teaches the invention set forth above. SONG further teaches\n(Fig.6A) that the pixel unit includes the two display regions (41, 42) disposed respectively on two\nsides of the data line (3) for driving the pixel unit. SONG further teaches (Fig.5) that the pixel unit\nincludes four display regions (41, 42, 43, 44) disposed respectively in four regions by the data line (3)\nfor driving the pixel unit and the gate line (2) for driving the pixel unit intersecting with each other.\nConcerning the pixel unit includes three display regions disposed on a same date line for driving the\npixel unit and on a same side of the gate line for driving the pixel unit that would be an obvious\nvariation and that would be obvious to those skilled in the art according to the forming process being\napplied.\n\nRegarding claim 19, any display devices can use such array substrate that are only given\n\nweight as intended use, and that would have been at least obvious.\n\nConclusion\n8. The prior art made of record and not relied upon is considered pertinent to\napplicant's disclosure.\nAny inquiry concerning this communication or earlier communications from the\nexaminer should be directed to MIKE OI whose telephone number is (571)272-2299.\n\nThe examiner can normally be reached on M-T 7:30 am-6:00 pm.\n\nApplication/Control Number: 14/064,521 Page 7\nArt Unit: 2871\n\nIf attempts to reach the examiner by telephone are unsuccessful, the examinerls\nsupervisor, Bumsuk Won can be reached on (571) 272-2713.
